### Hi there, I'm Tankiso - aka [@majortank](https://github.com/majortank) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Web Developer diving into the realms of JavaScript and Python (specifically Django), while also exploring the wonders of TypeScript. Currently, I'm tinkering with a couple of exciting projects:

ðŸš€ [PathPioneer](https://github.com/majortank/pathpioneer) - Creating an innovative pathfinding tool.
ðŸŽ¬ [AboutTheFilm](https://github.com/majortank/aboutthefilm) - Crafting a unique movie-centric platform.

ðŸŒ± Always learning and growing, I'm eager to collaborate on JavaScript/TypeScript projects that push boundaries and ignite creativity.

ðŸ“« Let's connect! Reach out to me at tankiso@tangikuu.tech for intriguing discussions or potential collaborations.
